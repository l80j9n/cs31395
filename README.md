Weight: 40%
Maximum Marks: 100
Overview  Outcomes 
This course work will be assessed for the following learning outcomes:
C. Illustrate the issues related to Web technologies and   DBMS and XML   as   a   semi-structured   data representation formalism.
D. Identify the principles underlying object-relational   models.
Submission 
You must submit the following files to   LMO:
1)A report named as Your_Student_ID.pdf.
2)A directory containing all your source code, named as Your_Student_ID_code.NOTE: The report shall be in A4 size,   size   11 font,   and   shall   not   exceed 8 pages   in   length. You   can include only key code snippets in your   reports. The   complete   source   code   can   be   placed   in   the attachment.
Assessment Tasks 
Now we have some stock-related datasets in XML format   (attached). We would   like to   put   it   on   a website for users to   query.
1)       Browse through these XML files in the   attachment, and   define   DTD   and   XML   Schema   for      them. Use both definitions to validate the XML files and   manually fix   any   potential   errors.   Extract the file headers from the XML Schema and convert the XML to CSV.   Open the generated CSV with any editor and take a screenshot.   (20   Marks)
2)       Use flask_sqlalchemy in   Flask to build   an   ORM for   the   CSV   from task   1),   and   import   the         data into PostgreSQL. Manually draw an   Entity-Relationship diagram for   the three   tables,   take a photo, and   include   it   in the   repo代 写Database Development and Design (DTS207TC) Assessment Task 2

3)       Use Flask to implement the   required   web   page   as   shown   in the   diagram,   which   includes   a      table with the necessary fields. To differentiate yourself, you can set the form. style. to your   preference and take a screenshot. (20   Marks)
4)       Based on task 3), add filtering functionalities for   stock   name,   start time,   and   end   time,
implementing a page as shown below. Note   that   one   or   more   of these filter   conditions   can   be empty, meaning no filtering based on that   condition. To   differentiate yourself, you   can      set the form. style. to your preference and take a screenshot.   (20   Marks)  

5)       Use the provided testing program   to   perform   a   performance   test   on   task 4). The   program         uses a POST request to query with all conditions   set to   empty,   which   should   return the   full      result set. As long   as the returned content   is correct, you   can   optimize   performance   in   any      way. Take a screenshot of the test results. Ideal performance   should   be   no   higher than   0.2   seconds per query.   (20   Marks)
NOTE:
a.          Provide a brief introduction to the   program   logic   in your own words;   including   code snippets is encouraged, but please do   not directly   paste the   entire   program   into   the   report   without explanation; b.       For your full academic development, the   use of generative AI to gain   inspiration   is   allowed      for this assignment; however, out of mutual respect,   please do   not   directly   paste   its   output   into   your assignment and submit   it;
c.       To prove that you have indeed completed this assignment   and   did   not   rely   solely   on   generative AI, please provide screenshots of the running   results for each   task.
